	Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are undoubtedly what comes to peoples’ minds when they talk about solar energy. Considering that in an hour, the sun radiates solar energy enough to cover for human energy consumption for a year, then going green with solar PV panels is perhaps in the right direction! However, with solar energy systems’ technology, we are still behind in capturing this naturally free vast amount of energy provided by nature.

Herein you can review some basic advantages and disadvantages of solar energy panels (PV panels) – for an extended analysis on this you may refer to pros and cons of Photovoltaic systems and pros and cons of Home solar panels.

<h4>Advantages of Solar Energy</h4>
<h5>1. Renewable Energy Source</h5>
Among all the benefits of solar panels, the most important thing is that solar energy is a truly renewable energy source. It can be harnessed in all areas of the world and is available every day. We cannot run out of solar energy, unlike some of the other sources of energy. Solar energy will be accessible as long as we have the sun, therefore sunlight will be available to us for at least 5 billion years when according to scientists the sun is going to die.</p>

<h5>2. Reduces Electricity Bills</h5>
<p>Since you will be meeting some of your energy needs with the electricity your solar system has generated, your energy bills will drop. How much you save on your bill will be dependent on the size of the solar system and your electricity or heat usage. Moreover, not only will you be saving on the electricity bill, there is also a possibility to receive payments for the surplus energy that you export back to the grid. If you generate more electricity than you use (considering that your solar panel system is connected to the grid).</p>

<h5>3. Diverse Applications</h5>
<p>Solar energy can be used for diverse purposes. You can generate electricity (photovoltaics) or heat (solar thermal). Solar energy can be used to produce electricity in areas without access to the energy grid, to distill water in regions with limited clean water supplies and to power satellites in space. Solar energy can also be integrated into the materials used for buildings. Not long ago Sharp introduced transparent solar energy windows.</p>


<h5>4. Low Maintenance Costs</h5>
<p>Solar energy systems generally don’t require a lot of maintenance. You only need to keep them relatively clean, so cleaning them a couple of times per year will do the job. If in doubt, you can always rely on specialised cleaning companies, which offer this service from around £25-£35. Most reliable solar panel manufacturers offer 20-25 years warranty. Also, as there are no moving parts, there is no wear and tear. The inverter is usually the only part that needs to be changed after 5-10 years because it is continuously working to convert solar energy into electricity and heat (solar PV vs. solar thermal). Apart from the inverter, the cables also need maintenance to ensure your solar power system runs at maximum efficiency. So, after covering the initial cost of the solar system, you can expect very little spending on maintenance and repair work.</p>

<h5>5. Technology Development</h5>
<p>Technology in the solar power industry is constantly advancing and improvements will intensify in the future. Innovations in quantum physics and nanotechnology can potentially increase the effectiveness of solar panels and double, or even triple, the electrical input of the solar power systems.</p>

<h6>PV panels provide clean – green energy. During electricity generation with PV panels there is no harmful greenhouse gas emissions thus solar PV is environmentally friendly.</h6>
<li>Solar energy is energy supplied by nature – it is thus free and abundant!</li>
<li>Solar energy can be made available almost anywhere there is sunlight.</li>
<li>Solar energy is especially appropriate for smart energy networks with distributed power generation – DPG is indeed the next generation power network structure!</li>
<li>Solar panels cost is currently on a fast reducing track and is expected to continue reducing for the next years – consequently solar PV panels has indeed a highly promising future both for economical viability and environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>Photovoltaic panels, through photoelectric phenomenon, produce electricity in a direct electricity generation way
Operating and maintenance costs for PV panels are considered to be low, almost negligible, compared to costs of other renewable energy systems.</li>
<li>PV panels have no mechanically moving parts, except in cases of sun-tracking mechanical bases; consequently they have far less breakages or require less maintenance than other renewable energy systems (e.g. wind turbines)</li>
<li>PV panels are totally silent, producing no noise at all; consequently, they are a perfect solution for urban areas and for residential applications (see solar panels for home).</li>
Because solar energy coincides with energy needs for cooling, PV panels can provide an effective solution to energy demand peaks – especially in hot summer months where energy demand is high.
<li>Though solar energy panels’ prices have seen a drastic reduction in the past years, and are still falling, nonetheless, solar photovoltaic panels are one of major renewable energy systems that are promoted through government subsidy funding (FITs, tax credits etc.); thus financial incentive for PV panels make solar energy panels an attractive investment alternative.</li>
<li>Residential solar panels are easy to install on rooftops or on the ground without any interference to residential lifestyle.</li>
